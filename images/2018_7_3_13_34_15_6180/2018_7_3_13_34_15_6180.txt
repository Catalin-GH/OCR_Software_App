syntax allows you to put the argument in as a placeholder without
using it. The idea is that you might want to change the function
definition to use the placeholder later, without changing all the
code where the function is called. Of course, you can accomplish
the some thing by using a named argument, but if you define the
argument for the function body without using it, most compilers
will give you a waming message, assuming you've made a logical
error. By intentionally leaving the argument name out, you
suppress this warning.

More important, if you start out using a function argument and
later decide that you dont need it, you can effectively remove it
without generating warnings, and yet not disturb any client code
